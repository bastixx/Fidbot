Fid's Broken Boner bot!

The aim of the game is to bet how many minutes it will take before FideliasFK either breaks his legs or dies in Arma 3.
The one with the closest time wins the title "Broken Boner"!

Commands below might not be completely up to date. Use !bonercommands to recieve the latest commands.

----------------------------------------
How it works:
To allow people to start betting enter !openbets. After bets are opened, enter !bet plus the number of minutes to enter the pool. 
When the mission starts use !starttimer. The bets will be closed and a timer will be started.
When Fid dies or breaks his legs enter !stoptimer. The timer will be stopped and a winner will be anounced.

The winner is the one with the closest bet, with a maximum of 5 minutes. If Fid does not break a leg or die he wins.
